*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

This article provides multiple resources to find help for using Configuration Manager.  

For help with product accessibility, see

##  <a name="bkmk_Info"></a> Product documentation  
 Use the following resources for additional information about Configuration Manager.  

-   To access the most current product documentation, start at the [library index](https://docs.microsoft.com/sccm/)

-   To provide feedback about the documentation, submit via [UserVoice](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/category/112371-documentation)  


###  <a name="BKMK_SearchTips"></a> Search the documentation library  
 Use the following search tips to help you find the information that you need:  

-   When using your preferred search engine to locate content for Configuration Manager, focus the search results to the current content library by including the following two terms, **SCCM** and **Docs**.

-   Use search terms that match terminology in the user interface and online documentation. Avoid unofficial terms or abbreviations that you might see in community content. For example, search for "management point" rather than "MP"; "deployment type" rather than "DT"; and "software updates" rather than "SUM."  

-   To search within an article you are currently viewing on docs.microsoft.com, select Ctrl+F, and then enter search terms in the browser's **Find** box. 

-   Each article on docs.microsoft.com includes the following fields to assist with searching the content:
    - **Search** in the upper right corner. To search all articles enter terms in this field. Articles in the Configuration Manager library  automatically include the "ConfigMgr" scope.
    - **Filter** above the left table of contents. To search the current table of contents enter terms in this field. This field only matches terms that appear in the article titles.
